# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- **Many new experimental native effects**, each with a matching software
  preview (camera + Lovelace cards) and, where applicable, a clock style:
  Blue Yellow, Ice Blue, Carousel (mode 56), Spectrum Crumble (mode 60),
  Spectrum Chase (mode 6), Pastel Pulse (mode 9), Ember (mode 24),
  Twinkle (mode 79), Solar Flare, Fireworks, Rainbow Flow, Pulse (mode 18),
  Spectrum Bands (mode 70), Color Trails (mode 35), Monochrome Waves (mode 11),
  Prism (mode 22), and Drift (a monochrome Aurora).

### Changed
- Renamed the **speed** setting to **Animation speed** and applied it to the
  clock as well.
- **Experimental dropdowns are now sorted** and the set of experimental clock
  styles was expanded.
- Widened clock-mixer effect coverage and aligned clock style names with their
  effects.

### Fixed
- Native effect animation no longer restarts on a brightness-only change.
- Removed clock styles that the firmware rejects.
- Fixed clock-mixer default color inheritance.
- Fixed lamp IP rediscovery.
- Enabled speed control for the Spectrum native effect.
- Corrected native-effect preview orientation.
- Fixed hassfest YAML validation by using a block scalar for the kwargs
  description.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- **Experimental Features switch**: reveals firmware-native animation modes that
  the official Yeelight app never exposed. Off by default.
- **"Blue White" native effect** (firmware mode 59) as the first experimental
  effect, with a software preview: a white front is born at a slowly wandering
  source, travels the mirrored column path, and lights up fully white where it
  meets its reflection at the fold. It renders identically for every direction,
  matching the hardware.
- **Clock style "Blue White Fade"**: the clock now animates the Blue White
  effect masked to the lit digit pixels (clock mixer 59).
- **Software previews for the remaining native effects** so the camera entity and
  Lovelace cards animate to match the lamp: Pinball, Shooting Star, Tide,
  Building block, Hacking, Flower Sea, Magic, Wonderland, Kaleidoscope, and
  Palette (all four arrow directions where the effect supports them).

### Changed
- **Kaleidoscope direction previews** now match the physical lamp. The four
  arrow presets were rotated 90° (Right→Up, Down→Right, Left→Down, Up→Left) so
  the on-screen arrow reflects what the lamp actually plays.
- Renamed the switch entity display name from "Extended Effects" to
  **"Experimental Features"** (internal id and stored state are unchanged, so
  existing installations keep their entity and setting).

### Fixed
- Corrected extended-effect lookups so selecting an experimental effect no longer
  raises a `KeyError`; activation, direction, and speed resolve through the merged
  effect registry.
- Fixed the FX Explorer mode table and clock-mixer detection.

### Performance
- Camera preview rendering (PNG encode and image decode/resize) now runs in the
  executor instead of the event loop.
- Reduced the camera frame interval to 0.3 s and shrank the preview image for
  smoother updates at lower cost.

### Compatibility
- Raised the minimum Home Assistant version to **2024.12.0**. The config flow
  imports `ZeroconfServiceInfo` from `homeassistant.helpers.service_info.zeroconf`,
  which only exists from 2024.12; the previous floor of 2024.1.0 let HACS offer the
  integration to installs where setup would fail. This bump also covers the
  `async_register_static_paths` (2024.7) and no-argument options-flow (2024.11)
  APIs already in use.

### Removed
- Dropped `Pillow` from `manifest.json` requirements; it ships with Home Assistant
  core, so declaring it could conflict with core's own pin.
- Removed `brand/logo.png` and `brand/logo@2x.png`, which were byte-identical
  copies of the icon images (~236 KB of duplicate payload per install).
