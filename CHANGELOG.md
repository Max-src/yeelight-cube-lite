## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- **Experimental Features switch**: reveals firmware-native animation modes that
  the official Yeelight app never exposed. Off by default.
- **"Blue White" native effect** (firmware mode 59) as the first experimental
  effect, with a software preview: a white front is born at a slowly wandering
  source, travels the mirrored column path, and lights up fully white where it
  meets its reflection at the fold. It renders identically for every direction,
  matching the hardware.
- **Clock style "Blue White Fade"**: the clock now animates the Blue White
  effect masked to the lit digit pixels (clock mixer 59).
- **Software previews for the remaining native effects** so the camera entity and
  Lovelace cards animate to match the lamp: Pinball, Shooting Star, Tide,
  Building block, Hacking, Flower Sea, Magic, Wonderland, Kaleidoscope, and
  Palette (all four arrow directions where the effect supports them).

### Changed
- **Kaleidoscope direction previews** now match the physical lamp. The four
  arrow presets were rotated 90° (Right→Up, Down→Right, Left→Down, Up→Left) so
  the on-screen arrow reflects what the lamp actually plays.
- Renamed the switch entity display name from "Extended Effects" to
  **"Experimental Features"** (internal id and stored state are unchanged, so
  existing installations keep their entity and setting).

### Fixed
- Corrected extended-effect lookups so selecting an experimental effect no longer
  raises a `KeyError`; activation, direction, and speed resolve through the merged
  effect registry.
- Fixed the FX Explorer mode table and clock-mixer detection.

### Performance
- Camera preview rendering (PNG encode and image decode/resize) now runs in the
  executor instead of the event loop.
- Reduced the camera frame interval to 0.3 s and shrank the preview image for
  smoother updates at lower cost.

### Compatibility
- Raised the minimum Home Assistant version to **2024.12.0**. The config flow
  imports `ZeroconfServiceInfo` from `homeassistant.helpers.service_info.zeroconf`,
  which only exists from 2024.12; the previous floor of 2024.1.0 let HACS offer the
  integration to installs where setup would fail. This bump also covers the
  `async_register_static_paths` (2024.7) and no-argument options-flow (2024.11)
  APIs already in use.

### Removed
- Dropped `Pillow` from `manifest.json` requirements; it ships with Home Assistant
  core, so declaring it could conflict with core's own pin.
- Removed `brand/logo.png` and `brand/logo@2x.png`, which were byte-identical
  copies of the icon images (~236 KB of duplicate payload per install).
